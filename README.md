# Project Descriptions for Team amw368

Please finalize your project and team by April 18th and update this README.md file accordingly.

## amw368
A sensor eg temperature periodically sends reading to the board. If the measurement value meets a certain threshold, the board will send a pulse to turn on a servo motor. Readings are continuous so depending on whether new readings meet the criteria, the servo can be turned off and on again.
