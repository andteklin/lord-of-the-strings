# Project Descriptions for Team apn32-axl3

Please finalize your project and team by April 18th and update this README.md file accordingly.

## apn32
## axl3
We want to build on top of an existing robot/drone such that we can move the robot/drone around to collect environmental data, such as temperature and light intensity. Then, to view the collected data, we want it to be sent to and displayed on a mobile app. To control the robot/drone, we may use the aforementioned mobile app or alternatively, a joystick.Â
