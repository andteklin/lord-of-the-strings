# Project Descriptions for Team ahl92-am2736-nsv23

Please finalize your project and team by April 18th and update this README.md file accordingly.

## ahl92
We wish to create a robotic guitar plucker mounted on the guitar body. As for software, we wish to program these sensors to move the strumming arm at a certain speed and direction in a loop. Much of the software will involve testing and debugging the sensor-to-arm control scheme and fine-tuning the movement of the strumming arm.Â

# Feedback

This is a great project and I would love to see this work! It is pretty ambitious. Do you have a robotic arm to work with? If you don't have an arm already, I suggest you use micro servos since you can control the position fairly easily and then mount a pick on the servo horn. The easiest would be to have one servo per string. 

How are you planning on mounting the device on the guitar? I would be happy to let you use some of our research lab's 3D printers if you need access.

Let me know some more details on how you plan to go about this and I am happy to give you more detailed advice.  If this ends up getting too difficult, focus on getting a subsystem to work first. Even with a simpler system you could do a great demo. For example, if you can pluck a single string, you could have the board pluck out a single-note background track and then play over it.


# Project Web-Page

The project web-pages will also be hosted on github in this repo in the "page" branch. You can edit it by switching branches and modifying the files, or by pushing to the branch. Here is a link to a minimal web-page that you can edit and modify: [https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2025/ahl92-am2736-nsv23](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2025/ahl92-am2736-nsv23)
