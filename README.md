Our project entails a previously- 3D-printed mask that was used on Dragon Day for the Phoenix. We plan to attach LEDs to the edges and eye-holes of the mask, and work on them reactive to dynamic movements and lights. An image of the mask pre-modification is shown in Figure 1. 

 

For our project, we have decided to modify a decorative mask that was previously 3D printed for use by the engineers in Dragon Day. The mask will have LEDs on its borders and in the eyeholes. The LED colors will change dynamically based on movement and the brightness of outside lights. There will also be a button on the ARM Microprocessor which, when pressed, will cause a specific combination of LEDs on the mask to light up. The mask will be wearable by a user via a velcro strap.
