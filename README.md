Please finalize your project and team by April 18th and update this README.md file accordingly.

## am2556
I want to create a gesture recognition system using the on-board accelerometer. I will be using LEDs to provide feedback on recognized gestures and concurrency for continuous monitoring and pattern recognition. As stretch goals, I would like to implement locks for a database where you can add new gestures and I would like to try to implement machine learning for gesture recognition.
