## ahl92
We wish to create a robotic guitar plucker mounted on the guitar body. As for software, we wish to program these sensors to move the strumming arm at a certain speed and direction in a loop. Much of the software will involve testing and debugging the sensor-to-arm control scheme and fine-tuning the movement of the strumming arm.Â ## am2736
