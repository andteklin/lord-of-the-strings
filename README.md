Our idea for this project is to control the brightness of an LED (utilizing the external LED board from Lab 2 and onwards) utilizing the capacitive touch sensor. With this on-board sensor, we want to be able to detect presses or holds, and utilize these patterns to increase or dim the brightness of the LED. 

For example, each touch might increase the LED brightness by 10%. Or, we could have 3 quick taps back-to-back, and this might flash the LED RGB 5x in a row to indicate the touch sensor picked up on the three quick taps.

Another thing we could do is incorporate a light dimmer where when we move from left to right on the sensor, the LED will increase (moving right) or decrease (moving left). ## vb353
