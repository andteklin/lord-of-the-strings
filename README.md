# Project Descriptions for Team dcp243

Please finalize your project and team by April 18th and update this README.md file accordingly.

## dcp243
I would like to use the board, its accelerometer, physical inputs (buttons and possibly capacitive touch slider), and USB communication to create a variation on Pictionary. One player would get a prompt and would tilt the board to move a cursor on program running on a separate computer. Holding one of the buttons on the board would allow them to draw. Time permitting, I would also add the ability to select a color using the capacitive slider, with the current color being indicated by a serial LED on the board. The other players would then have to guess the drawing in a certain time limit.
