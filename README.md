We would like to create a game similar to Subway Surfers. The playable character (probably a simple square) will be at the bottom of the screen. Three lanes will be available for the square to switch between. Obstacles will appear from the top on each lane and progressively move downwards. Some obstacles will have to be dodged either by 1) changing lanes or 2) jumping or ducking depending on what color the obstacle is.Â
