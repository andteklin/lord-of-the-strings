# Project Descriptions for Team ahl92-am2736-nsv23

The Lord of the Strings is more than just a simple guitar strummer. This robot attempts to implement palm muting, a technique for a more advanced guitarist. We wish to program the board to control the speed and strumming style. Much of the software will involve testing and debugging the sensor-to-arm control scheme and fine-tuning the movement of the strumming arm. We plan to add on a felt muting bar near the bridge to imitate the guitar palm muting technique.

# Additional Hardware
We plan to use SG90 servo motors to move the strumming arm and muting mechanism. 
We also plan to use a clamp or 3D print some mounting mechanism to secure the servo as it strums the strings.
We will use a 3D printed arm screwed onto the servo horn.
