Our project will be a Simon Says-type of game that will go on forever until the user is idle for a certain amount of time, the game gets cancelled, or the user presses the wrong button. We plan for the Simon Says-type game to have user input in the form of the button (which is like you doing the action based on Simon saying and if you do not do anything for a certain amount of time, we will proceed to the next game state). Every button will correspond to an LED, and you only press the button when the LED blink is preceded by a designated LED color (which represents Simon saying). We will also have an LCD screen to keep score on how well you are doing and if the game is ready to be played and to display if you want to cancel the game.Â
