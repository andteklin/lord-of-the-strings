# Project Descriptions for Team amc564-jl3896

Please finalize your project and team by April 18th and update this README.md file accordingly.

## amc564
The high level description of the project we have in mind is an LED array that lights up different LEDs to create “wave” like animations to mimic the sound input it “hears” via a microphone. We were planning on using some microphone and a specific type of communication protocol to listen to music playing and have the LEDs respond to the variations in volume, pitch, and other sound things like frequency.  We can use a FFT to collect data from the sound we are receiving from the microphones and use that to map out different LED patterns on the cube. The only concern we have is the difficulty of implementing FFT in C and if we are allowed to use any premade libraries to assist us in the process.

We may have to create a library for general LED patterns depending on our implementation (discussed below), we will have to build the LED array, we will have to have a FFT library and we will have some main implementation that combines all these elements together. We will go into more detail about each part below in the next question.## jl3896

# Project Web-Page

The project web-pages will also be hosted on github in this repo in the "page" branch. You can edit it by switching branches and modifying the files, or by pushing to the branch. Here is a link to a minimal web-page that you can edit and modify: [https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2025/amc564-jl3896](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2025/amc564-jl3896)
