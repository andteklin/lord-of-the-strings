We want to create a version of the game breakout. Our game will be similar to the game Breakout first made by Atari, where the user controls a rectangular paddle left and right across the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball up into bricks above. For each brick that the user destroys, they gain points. If the ball bounces down past the user’s paddle, the player loses a life. The game ends when the player loses their third life, or when they destroy all of the bricks on the screen.

We will use the FRDM-KL46Z microcontroller as a game controller, using the capacitive touch slider for paddle movement. We will run the game graphics and logic on an external computer connected to the microcontroller. ## jws434
