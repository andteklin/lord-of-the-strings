You can modify this page to create your final project page. Right now, the page is generated from a Markdown file (index.md) in the `page` branch. You can edit it directly from the git web interface or push it to the branch. There are a few [standard themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/) github provides. This one is `minimal`. If you'd like to change it, you can edit the `_config.yml` file.

The Markdown interface is easy, but if you would like to do something different you can add an index.html file to the branch (and any supporitng style sheets etc.) and it will be served as the webpage instead. 

# Expected page structure 

We would like your final project page to have the following structure:
- A very catchy title
- An overview section about the project
- A system diagram that shows the major hw/sw components and how they interact 
- A short video (3-4 min) that covers:
  - Who you are
  - Project title and idea
  - Technical approach
  - A demo of the working product
  - Any technical difficulties you faced or your testing/debugging approach. Think of what YOU would have liked to know BEFORE you started this project.
  - _Please keep to the 3-4min lenght since we will ask students to watch a bunch of these. If you want a longer video that goes into more detail you can add anohter one in the technical section_. 
- Technical approach (This should be more detailed than the information in the video)
- Testing / debugging aproach
- Team work (if applicable)
- Outside resrouces
