## ap2357
## dev38
For our final project we wanted to make a memory sequence game. Essentially, our game will light up the board's built in LEDs and the LEDs on the extension in a randomly generated sequence. The user must mimic this sequence. The sequence starts with 1 LED but every 'round' we guess the sequence correct, one more LED flash is added to it. If a user guesses incorrectly, the sequence restarts. We will incorporate visual feedback; the board's built in green LED will signal if we correctly guessed the sequence this round otherwise the red LED will flash. We also want to incorporate audio for when we click the buttons, guess correctly, and guess incorrectly.## nbt26

# Project Web-Page

The project web-pages will also be hosted on github in this repo in the "page" branch. You can edit it by switching branches and modifying the files, or by pushing to the branch. Here is a link to a minimal web-page that you can edit and modify: [https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2025/ap2357-dev38-nbt26](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2025/ap2357-dev38-nbt26)
