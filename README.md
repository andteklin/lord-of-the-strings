# Project Descriptions for Team ahl92-am2736-nsv23

Our primary goal involves creating a robotic guitar strummer mounted on the guitar body. We wish to program sensors and buttons on the board to control the speed and strumming style. Much of the software will involve testing and debugging the sensor-to-arm control scheme and fine-tuning the movement of the strumming arm.Â Later on, we plan to add on a muting mechanism to imitate the guitar palm muting technique.

# Additional Hardware
We plan to use SG90 servo motors to move the strumming arm and muting mechanism. 
We also plan to use a clamp or 3D print some mounting mechanism to secure the servo as it strums the strings.
We will use a 3D printed arm screwed onto the servo horn.

# Project Web-Page

The project web-pages will also be hosted on github in this repo in the "page" branch. You can edit it by switching branches and modifying the files, or by pushing to the branch. Here is a link to a minimal web-page that you can edit and modify: [https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2025/ahl92-am2736-nsv23](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2025/ahl92-am2736-nsv23)
