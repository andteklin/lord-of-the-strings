# Project Descriptions for Team ail36-sga46-stk49

Please finalize your project and team by April 18th and update this README.md file accordingly.

## ail36
The goal of the project will be to use the NXP FRDM-KL46Z to interface with a speaker, allowing the user to play a pre-programmed sound through an external speaker upon the press of an external button. The board will be programmed with a sequence of data that represents the sound to be played. When the user presses the button, the board will begin processing the stored sound information, sending information to the connected speaker. When done, the program will reset, allowing the user to press the button again to play the sound again. Pressing the button while the sound is being played will not cause the sound to be replayed, and the user will need to press the button after the sound finishes to restart it.## sga46
Create an interactive game of tetras by having the board control where the next blocks will be placed.Â ## stk49
