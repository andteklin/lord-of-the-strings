# Project Descriptions for Team ana59-nk548

Please finalize your project and team by April 18th and update this README.md file accordingly.

## ana59
For this project, we would like to create a simple and interactive text input system that allows users to "type" messages by physically tilting the FRDM-KL46Z board. The idea is to use the boardâ€™s built-in accelerometer to navigate through characters and its onboard buttons to select them. As the user tilts the board left or right, the system will scroll through a set of characters, and pressing a button will confirm the selection. The typed message will be displayed on the LCD or printed to a serial terminal. The goal is to demonstrate how onboard motion sensors and basic user input can be combined to build a creative and practical interface without the need for any external components.## nk548
