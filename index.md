# Lord of the Strings

## Overview
**Lord of the Strings** is more than just a simple guitar strummer. This robot also implements palm mutingâ€”a technique used by more advanced guitarists to dampen strings for rhythmic articulation.

Our initial ambition was to program the board to control both the speed and strumming style. At this stage, the onboard buttons allow users to switch between strumming styles and control the muting mechanism. We implemented timing mechanisms such as the TPM module to control servo movement and the PIT timer to schedule strumming and muting patterns with precise timing.
