## Outside Resources 
We took some inspiration in mounting the plate to the guitar as well as for the strumming motion from this resource we found online: https://www.instructables.com/AutoStrummer/
Understanding how buttons work: https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-connect-and-program-push-buttons-on-the-arduino/
MG90S datasheet: https://components101.com/motors/mg90s-metal-gear-servo-motor
FRDM board schematic: https://www.openhacks.com/uploadsproductos/frdm-kl46z_sch.pdf
TPM module inspiration: https://community.nxp.com/t5/Kinetis-Software-Development-Kit/How-to-set-Timer-PWM-Module-for-controlling-ESC/m-p/532399
Initial inspiration: https://hackaday.com/2018/01/31/strumbot-the-guitar-that-strums-itself/ 
KL46Z pinout: https://os.mbed.com/platforms/FRDM-KL46Z/

In addition, we used ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to help write and debug some of the code. It was able to give a good high-level implementation but lacked understanding of certain modules like the TPM and clock constraints. Thus, we still put in significant effort to debug and get the servos working.
