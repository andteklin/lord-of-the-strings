## Work Distribution

We organized tasks into three main categories: mechanical design, electrical setup, and software design.

- **Andrew** primarily worked on coding and debugging the software to achieve the desired servo motions and handle button inputs. 
- **Adin** focused on the mechanical design for the string muting system and also contributed to code debugging and testing servo signal generation.
- **Nathan** designed the servo-controlled strumming arm, the servo mount, and the mounting plate that clamps onto the guitar. He also implemented strumming pattern logic and helped clean up and organize the codebase.
