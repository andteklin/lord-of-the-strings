## Work Distribution
We organized tasks into mechanical design, electrical setup, and coding. Andrew primarily worked on coding and debuggin the FRDM board to control the servo PWM pulses and button control. Adin worked on the mechanical design for the string muting system and helped with code debugging and servo signal pulsing. Nathan designed the servo-controlled strumming arm, servo mount, and mounting plate that clamps onto the guitar. He also coded the strumming patterns and cleaned up the code.
